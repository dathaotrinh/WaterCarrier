# How To Use App

### Playing Game
* From the home page, you can play the game without having an account
* Simply choose the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) -> this will start the clock to count the time you spend on each question.
* The bar chart will then show multiple poles
* Each pole represents a side of a container and 2 poles make up a container (with the base of the bar chart is the base of that container)
* Your task is to calculate the maximum water the containers in the bar chart can carry.
* Hint: the amount of water that a container can carry is calculated by width * length
* width is the distance between pole n and pole m abs(m - n).
* height is the minimum height between pole n and pole m.
* The quicker you answer the question, the higher score you get.
* Once you type in your answer, click submit to stop the clock and calculate the score.
